The location is just nice; a few feet away from the Myeongdong train station, and it’s just across the street from the shopping area!! AND there’s a Starbucks just next to the hotel!! There’s 2 Oliveyoung branches near the hotel, which made it really convenient for shopping, and a nearby small 7-11 convenience store for any late night cravings ☺️✨ I also managed to exchange my small notes for bigger notes with the help of the staff, and they’re willing to go the extra mile to search up the stores I wanted to visit (but didn’t know where the nearest branch was) if they were unsure themselves. Really friendly people, and they have free storage lockers for hotel guests who would like to store their luggages before their check-in time. Outside customers who wish to use their storage lockers may do so at a small price, so I think it’s quite worth it!! It’s located at exit 2 from the Myeongdong station.

I think you should still give it a go, but it's more of a park than a garden. The palace grounds are extensive. If you enjoy strolling around parks and nature, this is def a good option to enjoy that. There was one petrol colored lacquered roof that really stood out from the usual affair.

The market is known for its wide variety of wholesale local goods, imported items, and affordable street food. Seeing the street food vendors was genuinely tempting as we strolled through the market. However, the chilly air from the intense air conditioner at a local restaurant in the food alley beckoned us inside. We ordered Jaeyuk Bokkum (spicy pork with mixed veggies), fried rice, and a refreshing cider (Korean version of Sprite). To our surprise, the total cost was much less than we would have paid in the USA. The portions were generous, and the flavors were simply delightful.

After fleeing to Sinuiju for the second time, he asked the Ming Dynasty Emperor Manryeokse for help. The Ming Dynasty dispatched Jin Lin, commander-in-chief of the naval forces, and Li Yeo-song, commander-in-chief of the army, to Joseon. In appreciation of this, Guan Yu, the most resourceful and courageous man in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, set during Luo Guanzhong's Spring and Autumn Warring States period, was named in the direction of the sun rising in the east, and a shrine was built to commemorate Guan Yu's bravery, loyalty, and love for the people. A family shrine was built under the name of Guan Yuji Temple (東關羽之墓). Later, the name of Gamyo Shrine was shortened because it was too long, and the name was changed from \"Dongguan Ujimyo\" to \"Dongmyo\", which is a combination of the first letter \"dong\" and the second letter \"myo.\" That name is what it is today.\n",

After fleeing to Sinuiju for the second time, he asked the Ming Dynasty Emperor Manryeokse for help. The Ming Dynasty dispatched Jin Lin, commander-in-chief of the naval forces, and Li Yeo-song, commander-in-chief of the army, to Joseon. In appreciation of this, Guan Yu, the most resourceful and courageous man in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, set during Luo Guanzhong's Spring and Autumn Warring States period, was named in the direction of the sun rising in the east, and a shrine was built to commemorate Guan Yu's bravery, loyalty, and love for the people. A family shrine was built under the name of Guan Yuji Temple (東關羽之墓). Later, the name of Gamyo Shrine was shortened because it was too long, and the name was changed from \"Dongguan Ujimyo\" to \"Dongmyo\", which is a combination of the first letter \"dong\" and the second letter \"myo.\" That name is what it is today.\n",
